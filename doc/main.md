# Introduction

## Why yet another library

bien différencier "pas de transition dans un état" => état puits qui permet de sortir de la sous-machine et lancer une transition dans le parent, de "pas de transition retournant true" qui fait juste rien

## The Machines philosophy

C does not mean "not object". Actually the whole Machines library is
built using object-oriented techniques: one may find encapsulation,
polymorphism, and even some design patterns (composites, factories,
visitors).
